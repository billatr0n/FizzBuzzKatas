#FizzBuzz Daily Katas
Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"?), a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs. The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese martial arts in general.

#####A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer,[1] in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 21 different katas.[2]



**FizzBuzz** is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job interviews. The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100,

if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
else, print the number.
